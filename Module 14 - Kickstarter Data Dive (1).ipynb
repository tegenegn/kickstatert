    "Kickstarter is a company that provides the space for independent artists, creative, innovators, and entrepreneurs to bring their unique projects to life. Kickstarter allows anyone to financially support the project through an online pledging system - this means; anyone can pledge a specific amount of money towards the funding goal of the project. Kickstarter projects (also called campaigns) are all-or-nothing -- meaning, if the funding goal isn't met 100% (or exceeded), the project campaign fails and no funding is provided. The stakes are high - but what is it about certain campaigns that make them succeed while others fail? \n",
    "\n",
    "You have joined the marketing team for Kickstarter and you are tasked with exploring the features of several campaigns over the past few years. You are responsible for looking at this dataset and pulling out key insights about the characteristics of Kickstarter campaigns that make them more likely to succeed or fail. The marketing team at Kickstarter has a limited amount of funds to devote to highlighting specific projects, and they want to highlight projects that have the best chance of succeeding (i.e. meeting the funding goal). Can you help them determine who that might be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the steps below to take a dataset from inception to insights, for the purpose of answering the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. What kinds of projects should the Kickstarter Marking Team focus their attention on?\n",
    "    2. Why should the Marketing Team focus their attention in that direction?\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have combed through the data, your group will put together a presentation (including visualizations), that clearly answers the two questions above. The Kickstarter dataset is posted to Canvas. Complete the code in the notebook below to complete the project. <b> You are NOT restricted to the steps laid out in this notebook to complete your project, You can conduct additional analyses or create additional visualizations. This notebook is everything you need to cover, but feel free to expand on these steps! This includes completing regression analyses with the dataset.</b>"

In addition to exploring the relationships between your other independent variables, you want to pay close attention to the relationship between your independent variables and state. Follow the steps below to explore the relationships between your variables. In addition, you are tasked with creating visualizations related to your results.
